ARP Spoofer
Overview
This project implements a basic ARP spoofing tool using Python and Scapy. ARP spoofing allows an attacker to intercept communication between devices on the same network by sending falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages. This can be used to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.

How ARP Spoofing Works
What is ARP?
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to map an IP address to a MAC (Media Access Control) address in a local network. Devices use ARP to discover the MAC address of a device with a particular IP address before sending any data to that device.

ARP Spoofing:
In an ARP spoofing attack:

The attacker sends fake ARP responses to the target device and the gateway (router).
The target believes the attacker’s machine is the gateway, and the gateway believes the attacker’s machine is the target.
This allows the attacker to intercept, modify, or block the communication between the two devices.
How This Script Works:
The script continuously sends forged ARP responses to both the target device and the gateway.
The target device's ARP table is poisoned so it believes the attacker's machine is the gateway.
Similarly, the gateway's ARP table is poisoned to think the attacker's machine is the target.
The attacker can now intercept traffic between the target and the gateway.

Installation
Install Scapy:

bash
Copy code
pip install scapy
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/arp-spoofer.git
cd arp-spoofer
Run the ARP spoofer:

bash
Copy code
python arp_spoofer.py -t <target_ip> -g <gateway_ip>
Requirements
Python 3.x
Scapy library
Usage
php
Copy code
python arp_spoofer.py -t <target_ip> -g <gateway_ip>
Example:
bash
Copy code
python arp_spoofer.py -t 192.168.1.5 -g 192.168.1.1
-t or --target: The target IP address (victim's IP).
-g or --gateway: The gateway IP address (router's IP).
How to Stop the Spoofing:
The script can be stopped by pressing Ctrl + C. This will stop sending ARP spoof packets.
