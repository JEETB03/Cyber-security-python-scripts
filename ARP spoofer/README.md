# ARP Spoofer

## Overview
This project implements an ARP spoofing tool using Python and the [Scapy](https://scapy.net/) library. ARP spoofing is a technique used to intercept communication between two devices on the same network by sending falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages. The attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to intercept, modify, or block communication between the devices.

### What is ARP?
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a network protocol used to map an IP address to a MAC (Media Access Control) address in a local network. Devices use ARP to discover the MAC address associated with a specific IP address before sending data.

### ARP Spoofing Attack
In an ARP spoofing attack, the attacker sends fake ARP responses to both the target and the gateway (router), tricking them into updating their ARP tables with incorrect MAC addresses. This poisons their ARP caches and makes them send traffic to the attacker instead of the intended recipient.

1. **Target Device** thinks the attacker is the gateway (router).
2. **Gateway** thinks the attacker is the target device.
3. **Attacker** can now intercept traffic between the target and the gateway.

---

## How the Script Works

This Python script continuously sends forged ARP responses to both the target device and the gateway:

- The **target** device’s ARP cache is poisoned to believe that the attacker’s MAC address belongs to the gateway’s IP.
- The **gateway** (router) is tricked into believing that the attacker’s MAC address belongs to the target’s IP.
- Once the ARP tables are poisoned, the attacker can intercept, modify, or stop the communication between the target and the gateway.

## Installation

To run this tool, you need Python 3.x and the Scapy library installed.

1. Install [Scapy](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html):
    ```bash
    pip install scapy
    ```

2. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/arp-spoofer.git
    cd arp-spoofer
    ```

## Usage

The tool can be used by specifying the target and gateway IP addresses.

### Basic Command
```bash
python arp_spoofer.py -t <target_ip> -g <gateway_ip>
```

### Example:
```bash
python arp_spoofer.py -t 192.168.1.5 -g 192.168.1.1
```

- `-t` or `--target`: The target IP address (victim's IP).
- `-g` or `--gateway`: The gateway IP address (router's IP).

### Stopping the Spoofing:
The spoofing can be stopped by pressing `Ctrl + C`. This will stop the continuous sending of ARP spoof packets.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Scapy**: Python library for manipulating network packets. Install it using `pip`.

## How to Restore ARP Tables

To restore the original ARP tables (i.e., undo the spoofing), you can send correct ARP packets to both the target and the gateway to restore their ARP caches:

```bash
python arp_spoofer.py --restore -t <target_ip> -g <gateway_ip>
```

## Disclaimer

This tool is for educational purposes only. Do not use it on networks or devices that you do not own or have permission to test. Unauthorized ARP spoofing can cause network disruptions and is illegal in many jurisdictions.
